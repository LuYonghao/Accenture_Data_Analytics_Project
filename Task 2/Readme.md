# Task 2 Data Cleaning & Modeling

### Task 2:
  - Look at the task that you’ve been assigned and think about which available data sets may be useful to fulfill the requirements.
  - Ensure that the data is clean and ready for analysis, removing columns that have a high number of missing values, removing rows that have values which are erroneous, changing the data type of some values within a column and also removing columns which are not relevant to this task
  - Finally, use this knowledge to create a final data set containing all of the columns that you will need to complete the task
